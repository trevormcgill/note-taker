# Note Taker

## Description
In this challenge, I was provided with starter code to create a Note Taker application, which allows users to write, save, and retrieve notes. The application utilizes an Express.js back end and stores note data in a JSON file. My responsibility was to develop the back end, connect it with the pre-built front end, and deploy the entire application on Heroku.

To achieve this, I set up necessary routes in the `server.js` file using Express and implemented API routes to handle note-related operations, such as retrieving, saving, and deleting notes. After connecting the back end with the front end, I deployed the application to Heroku. The end result is a fully functional Note Taker application that provides users with a convenient and efficient way to organize their thoughts and ideas.
